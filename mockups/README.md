# Mockups

Pages for looking at designs before they are built into the game. Each is a single HTML file that runs on its own in a
browser (three.js comes from a CDN), and each has been published as a private claude.ai artifact.

- `creatures.html`: the overseer and its hand, with their states and the knock code.
- `elders.html`: the elders of the lineage (`docs/world.md` §10), at true scale beside a 1.8 m figure, in the game's own
  kit of boxes, cylinders and icosahedra: Pia (her three stages), Ines, Dale and his line, Sam, Tom, and Holt's cave. One
  tab each; buttons switch states. `window.__rs` in the console exposes each scene and its `set…` function.
- `mutants.html`: a bench for Security's changed (`docs/world.md` §8), in the game's kit: sliders for their build and
  their walk (the floor moves at the walk's pace, so a planted foot should hold still), what they still wear, and growth
  clicked onto them (eyes, pustules, leaf shelves, stalks, roots, knots; the wheel sizes them). Saves designs as JSON
  (`rootshock-changed/1`, described at the top of its script); the published copy keeps them where Claude can read them.
  *Security's seven* (the Saved tab) is a line-up of the upper station's changed, one for each, newest to oldest;
  *Pia's lines* are examples of the bone, bloat and plant lines that founded the Commons, young to old and each young god.
  *The green lines* are the lines whose plant comes first, as you would meet them (`docs/world.md` §10, *The green
  lines*): the bush's middle years, the flower child's, the root ancestor's young and planted, the bark ancestor's, and
  one of Tom's; three ridden by what came out of their chests, some still carrying what was in their hands; and the
  flower child's line gathering its flowers into one, on a tail and, on the flower child, for an arm. *The bush* (in
  *Pia's lines*) is built *Grown*: plant for flesh, not leaf on a man.
  `window.__rs` in the console exposes the state.
- `lineage.html`: the family tree and an entry for each elder. Generated: edit `lineage/template.html` (the cards) or
  `lineage/build.py` (the tree's nodes), then run `python3 mockups/lineage/build.py`.

**Testing offline.** Where the CDN cannot be reached, a headless browser can serve three.js from `node_modules`: route
`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/**` to `node_modules/three/build/`.

**Set aside.** June, a sixth elder, was mocked up and shelved; her tab is in the history at `e0672ba`.
