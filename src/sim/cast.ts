/* The cast (engine.md §7, §8): what lives in the station, ported from the first engine's behaviours. Each is a body that
   walks like yours, so it has weight, falls, rides platforms and is stopped by what stops you; they block each other
   and you. They find their way over the nav graph's fields, see along lines of sight scaled by the light you stand in,
   and hear what you do as far as the sound of it carries through the rooms between.

   Here: their kinds, their making, and a step of them all. Their parts are in cast/: getting about (move.ts), seeing
   and hearing you (senses.ts), the fight (blows.ts), Security's staff (husk.ts), and the night round and the other
   patient (round.ts); how each kind moves, its gait (gait.ts). What the rest of the game uses of those parts it takes
   from here. The parts take only types from this file, so the AI table below finds every behaviour made.

   A new kind is a row in MT (its body, and the behaviour that steps it), one in GAIT if it moves unlike the kind whose
   behaviour it shares, and one in WAYS (sim/fields.ts) if it gets about unlike any there; engine.md §6, how the cast
   move, has the rest (its blow, its model). */
