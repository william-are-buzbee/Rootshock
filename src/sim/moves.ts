/* Moves and reactions (engine.md §6, F2). One kind of blow for everything that fights: a wind-up (the tell), a strike
   (the short part that lands), and a recovery (your time, longer when it met nothing). Yours are worked out from what
   you hold; the cast's are written here. Over every blow sits the reaction ladder: a hit takes poise, and what it does
   depends on what is left. Thresholds, never a roll: the same blow does the same thing every time, so it can be learned.

   - none: it took the hit and goes on. A blow in a part that has armour (a thresher's arms, a skitter rearing) is
     not stopped by a hit lighter than its armour.
   - flinch: a wind-up or strike is lost; a moment's pause.
   - stagger: its poise is broken. It reels, open, for a while, and its poise comes back whole.

   Past stagger: knocked down, and thrown (below). Your own blows are never stopped (engine.md §6, F2 as built). */
