/* Security's eyes and voice (world.md §8): cameras, and the zone alarms they sound. Nothing here was built for this:
   it is Security's own equipment, CCTV on a lockdown protocol, and nobody sits behind the screens. The lockdown arms
   the restricted rooms (RoomDef.armed), and a camera hung in one guards it: with power it sees along its cone, as far
   as the light you are in lets it (as the cast see), and it takes anyone moving in an armed room at any pace, held in
   view a moment; stand stock still and it loses you, as motion detection does. Anywhere else a camera only records,
   and shows no light. A guard's light is the tell: green while it watches, red while it holds you, so there is time
   to step back out or freeze. The alarm sounds from the zone's speaker for a while, and every one of the changed that
   hears it hurries to the speaker, not to you (sim/cast.ts, 'answer'). The answers: keep out of the armed rooms or out
   of the cone, freeze, cut its power, or smash it (loud); or smash the zone's speaker (as loud), and the zone has no
   voice. */
