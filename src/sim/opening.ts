/* The opening (world.md §8, The opening): the first minutes of a new game, in the isolation suite. The wing's feed was
   cut days ago; the suite runs on its own small backup set, kept for its locks, its readers and its pumps, and failing:
   its fittings flicker, low. Most of it is the station working: the night round on the dark balcony, the readers, the
   fail-safe locks, the noise the other patient makes and the night round coming to it, sweeping each room it opens with
   its beam. What is kept here is only what has to be timed:
   - wake: your pump's empty-bag alarm, and you weak from days under. When you have stood at your door or window a few
     seconds (or, if you do not, a while later) the other patient sees you, and starts on the glass;
   - scene: the night round comes down to the noise: it strikes the other patient down, drags them out into the hall and
     grafts them there, and searches the rooms, yours last (sim/cast.ts, its first time round);
   - left: it has gone back up to the wing. A few seconds on, the suite's set dies, and its fail-safe locks let go
     (sim/movers.ts, failSafe);
   - black: everything out, a moment, before the suite's emergency cells come up (they wait to, as real ones do);
   - done. */
