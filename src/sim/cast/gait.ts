/* How each kind of the cast gets about (engine.md §6, the cast by velocity; how the cast move): its paces, by what it is
   doing; how fast it changes its pace, and turns; and its feet. A behaviour asks for a pace by name (`pace(m, 'hunt')`)
   and moves by the ways in move.ts, which do the rest by its gait. So two kinds can share a behaviour and still move
   as themselves (the night round is a husk after you, slower), and a new kind is a row here, not a change to how
   anything walks. A kind with no row takes its behaviour's; one fixed where it is, none.

   One of the cast can be given its own pace by the level (`walk`, m/s, in mut()'s options): every pace of its kind's is
   scaled to it, the hunt as well as the walk, so a slow one is slow at everything. And its own steps (`steps`, a minute,
   walking): with the pace they make its stride. Not given, a slower one takes fewer steps and shorter, each by the square
   root of how much slower it is, as a slow walk does. Its footfalls come as often as its steps; its walk is drawn, and its
   prints laid, by its stride and steps against its kind's (`stride`, `cadence`), so a slow one shuffles and does not
   skate. Security's seven have theirs from the bench (mockups/mutants.html). */
