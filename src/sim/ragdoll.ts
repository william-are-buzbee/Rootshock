/* Corpses (engine.md §6, bodies with physics, as built). What dies goes loose: a handful of points, each a ball of
   some weight, held at their distances by sticks, falling and sliding against the world as the world answers anything
   (the grid, the props, the sloped surfaces, doors, platforms and crates); not a solver, and nothing the world does not
   already know. Points move by where they were and where they are (verlet), so a stick or a wall that moves one moves
   its speed with it. The cast's models are boxes on joints; each box rides the points of its joint (castView.ts, RIG),
   so the silhouette is the model's own. Plain numbers, no chance in it: the same blow drops the same body the same
   way, every time.

   A corpse is awake while it moves, and sleeps once still, as a loose crate does (loose.ts): asleep it costs nothing.
   No more than RAG.budget are awake at once; past that, the longest-awake one that has had time to fall sleeps where
   it is. */
