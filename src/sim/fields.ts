/* How far every spot is from you, for each way of getting about, and for sound (engine.md §7, §8). Kept fresh in
   rotation: one field a step, so each is at most a few steps old and no single step pays for all of them.

   A way (WAYS) is what a body needs and can do to get about: the headroom it needs, how wide it is, the step it walks up
   and the drop it takes, the doors it gets through, and whether it can call a platform. Each kind of the cast walks one
   (sim/cast.ts, MT); a new kind that fits none of these is a new row, and gets a field of its own on a level whose cast
   walks it. Its size keeps it to where it fits (`sized`); its body climbs what its way does (body.ts, `climb`). Who
   passes a door (as the first engine had it):
   - under: a door that is open, or jammed part open (they go under), or one that opens by itself for anything near;
   - hands: any door a hand can work: not welded, not a panel, not the lift's, not jammed, not heavy, not locked;
   - none: no doors at all. They are too big for the frames.
   Platforms: anything rides one that goes by itself; a hand can call one that has power.
   A refuge (`safe`) is only kept out of the cast's rounds; a hunter follows you into one, as it always did. */
