/* The station's way of laying out a level, in plan metres (x east, z south; y up from the surface).

   A level is one or more floors, each a walkable layer at its own height (a hall, and walkways over it). On a floor are
   rooms (boxes, or any outline), and doors in the walls between them; caves and their terrain; stairs and platforms to
   the floor above; and what stands about. Rock is everywhere nothing is laid out, so a wall is whatever is left
   between two rooms: draw two rooms half a metre apart and there is a partition between them, faced on each side with
   that room's own finish; draw them touching and they are one space. A wall at an angle is a wall of its own (wall()).

   Nothing is built until finishLevel(), which compiles every floor into the world's shapes: rooms carved in the grid,
   floor slabs under every upper floor, walkways with rails at their open edges, doors with doorways, platforms, cave
   surfaces from the terrain fields, ceiling fittings, and the props. A door is placed by the middle of its opening; which
   way it faces, how deep its doorway is, what it looks like, and which end it slides into are found from the rooms
   either side of it and the wall beside it. Where layout is asked about (what is beside a door, under a walkway's edge,
   under a slab), it is asked of each floor painted on the world's quarter-metre grid, the later of two things laid out
   in one place being what is there. */
