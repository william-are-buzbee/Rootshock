/* A corpse, drawn (engine.md §6, bodies with physics). The sim moves a body's points (sim/ragdoll.ts); each box of the
   model rides the points of its joint. A torso is a frame: an origin, an up and a side, from its points. A limb is a
   bone: from one point to another, turned from its parent as little as takes it there, so it does not twist on its own.
   Each part is fixed to its frame as the model stands idle, so a body lying still is the model's own shape laid down.
   What is not tied to a frame (a thresher's ribs) stays as it was at the moment of death, on its
   parent. Going loose is not a cut: the model goes from where it was drawn to where its points are over BLEND; and
   one knocked down comes back out of its points into its animation as it gets up. */
