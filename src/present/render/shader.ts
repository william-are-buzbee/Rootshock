/* One shader for everything, carried over from the first engine.
   Light = the level's light (read point by point from its light field for the level itself, per object for things that
   move, per vertex for glass) + the lights you carry + the lights lying about, flat-shaded from screen-space derivatives.
   No ambient floor: unlit is black. A colour channel above 1.5 is emissive. A light fitting (a tube, a lamp) is lit by
   its room's light many times over (its `glow`), so it goes out with the room; it and anything emissive that is bright
   are drawn brighter than white (EMIT), so they glow in the picture (post.ts).
   Every light that is not the level's is drawn by LIGHTS below, in every shader that draws into the scene (motes,
   prints and drips too), from the numbers in world/light.ts, so a light is the same light wherever it falls and falls
   once. The flashlight is a reflector's beam: a hot centre, a faint bright ring at its rim, a wide dim spill; in your
   hand it shines from your hand (uFlashPos, your left, a little below the eye), aimed at what you look at, with a
   shadow map of its own (HELD, beams.ts), so what stands in it throws a shadow you can see, sliding as you sweep the
   beam; and what it lights close by throws some of it back around you (uBounce, measured by one ray a frame in
   camera.ts). Put down still on, it is the same beam from its lens, with a shadow map of its own, and what it throws
   back is in the level's light.
   The level's light (world/lightField.ts, put on the card by lightVolume.ts) is blended from the 2³ points around a
   pixel, a little off the surface into the open, taking only those on its open side that open space joins to the
   nearest: so light falls off smoothly across a room and through a doorway, and none comes through a wall or a slab.
   The part of it from tubes that stutter dims with them (uFlick), wherever it has reached. With it comes which way the
   light comes from there (uLD: how much of it from one way, and which), blended the same way, so a surface takes it by
   how it faces it (DIR): the wall facing a lamp or a lit doorway more than the one side on to it, a floor under
   fittings more than the ceiling beside them, and a bump catches it on the side it comes from. What takes a highlight
   (gloss) takes one from that light too, a soft sheen, so a polished floor shows a streak toward a lamp. Light that
   comes from every way (a room's fill) is taken as before.
   Your body stands in the way of the fittings over you (selfShade): a few capsules (selfView.ts) against the nearest
   fittings of the room you are in, each taking back its share of the light where it falls, soft-edged, wider and
   fainter the further it falls from you.
   What every shader here writes is light as it is, brighter than white where it is: the eye (uExpo: wide in the dark,
   narrowed in light; main.ts), the glow, the tone curve and the grain are the picture's, made once from it (post.ts).

   What a surface is made of (content/materials.ts, by aMat) is drawn on it, from where it is: the level's in the
   world, so a pattern runs on across faces, a moving thing's in its own frame, so a pushed crate's boards go with it.
   No textures but one of noise, made here. Each pattern gives a shade, a height and how glossy each part is (mortar is
   not, the block's paint is): the shade is the colour's, the height tips the surface's facing (bump, from how it
   changes across the screen), and the gloss is the carried lights' highlight. The beam, its facing and its highlight
   are reckoned from your hand, a little below and to the left of the eye (uFlashPos), so the relief of what is close is
   raked by it. Each detail fades to its average where a pixel is too wide for it (keep: far off, or seen at a slant),
   and the fine detail with distance, where it would only shimmer. The level's walls also show wear: grime at their
   foot, water run down from the ceiling in places.
   All of it is surface detail, the player's to turn off (uDetail, setDetail): off, every surface is its flat colour
   and the beam's facing is reckoned from the eye, as it was before materials were drawn. */
