/* You, drawn: a body under the eye, in the coverall your sleeve already shows (handsView.ts), so you see your legs and
   chest when you look down and a light lying about throws your shadow. Rough blocks, as the cast are.
   What the eye would only see the inside of, it is not shown: the head, and the arms (the hand in front of the camera is
   handsView's). Those are on SHADOW_ONLY, which the beams' shadow cameras see and the eye does not, so your shadow
   has a head and arms all the same.
   The fittings over you throw it too, though the level's light is worked out once and nothing that moves stands in it:
   the body is handed to the level's shader as capsules (SELF in shader.ts), with the nearest lit fittings of the room
   you are in, and each takes back its share of the light where it falls.
   Feet keep to the floor by working each leg back from where its foot is (two bones, thigh and shin), and land in
   step with the footsteps you hear: a whole stride (both feet) is the distance between two of them (sim.ts), and the
   right foot comes down on the sound. Looks only. */
