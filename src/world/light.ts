   (world/lightField.ts has the shape of it all). The renderer draws by the same light, point by point, and the sim reads
   it for how visible you are (engine.md §11).

   Lights that lie about (a flashlight put down still on, a lantern) are the same lights as in your hand, with the same
   numbers (FLASH, BOUNCE, LANTERN below; render/shader.ts draws all of them from these): a flashlight's beam is drawn by
   the renderer with its own shadows and added here only for what the cast see (`seen`); what it throws back, and a
   lantern's glow, go into the field like any light, so whatever is lit by them is lit by them once. */
